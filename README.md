Follow me [@wesnolte](http://twitter.com/wesnolte)

Voodoo is a todo list application that demonstrates the power of JavaScript MV* frameworks (specifically KnockoutJS) and Force.com through the use of JavaScript Remoting.

Features include:

* Looks just like Salesforce.
* Lightning fast.
* Most simple todo features supported.

##Knockout.js

Knockout is awesome and I encourage you to [learn more](http://learn.knockoutjs.com) about it.

##Still to be done

* Add proper response handling in the JS Remoting call backs.
* Add unit testing for the Knockout code.
* Test the Apex Controller.
* More comments are always good!
